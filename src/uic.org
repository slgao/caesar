*** UIC code unique values by last three years.
    By querying all marked suspects by the analysts from UST02 runs in year 2018, 2019 and 2020, 
    I have got all the unique UIC values as below: 

    array([   0.,   21.,  112.,  113.,  132.,  133.,  135.,  211.,  212.,

*** UIC Interpretation. 

    The defects are associated with UIC code, which can be interpreted into human understandable defects.
    To convert from UIC code to descriptive names like (HC) horizontal cracking and so on not only help us to better understand the 
    defect type without losing much class information. More importantly, this can reduce the number of classes 
    (multiple UIC codes correspond to one type of defect) need to be determined, which 
    will facilitate the task.

**** Short conclusion

The interpreted classes are as below.

HC = {112, 132, 1321, 1322, 212, 422, 2321, 2322}

TC = {211, 411, 421, 431, 471}

RCF = {221, 227, 224, 2223, 2252}

BHC = {135, 235, 236}

BEV = {0}

VSH = {113, 133, 213, 233}

OTHER = {21[fn:8], ...[fn:9]}

HC, TC, RCF, BHC, BEV ... (VSH ..)



[fn:1]BEV :: loss of bottom echo (loss of coupling)
[fn:2]HC :: horizontal crack
[fn:3]VSH :: vertical crack, longitudinal, not so interested for now.
[fn:4]BHC :: bolt hole crack
[fn:5]TC :: transversal crack
[fn:6]RCF :: rolling contact fatigue, includes squats.
[fn:7]although 232 was not recorded, can also be added to the list as a class HC.
[fn:8]UIC code 21 means the defect is not defined due to some reason will be classified as OTHER.
[fn:9]Other rarely occured UIC code not in the list will be classified as OTHER.
